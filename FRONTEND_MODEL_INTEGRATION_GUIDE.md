# Frontend-to-Trained Model Integration Guide

## 🎯 Current Status

✅ **Your trained model EXISTS**: `dark-nexis-backend/models/training/best_deepfake_model.pth` (44.8MB)
✅ **Backend integration is configured**: Uses `trained_model_worker.py` → `analyze_with_trained_model()`
✅ **Frontend now properly calls backend APIs**
❌ **Backend services not running** (need to start for full integration)

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Frontend Flow (Fixed)
1. **Upload**: `UploadCard.tsx` → calls `/api/upload` → gets S3 presigned URL
2. **S3 Upload**: Direct upload to S3 with progress tracking  
3. **Analysis**: Calls `/api/analyze` → triggers your trained model
4. **Results**: Shows analysis results with model metadata

### Backend Flow (Already Configured)
1. **File Upload**: `/api/upload` → creates file record + S3 URL
2. **Analysis**: `/api/analyze` → calls `analyze_with_trained_model(file_path, analysis_id)`
3. **Your Model**: `trained_model_worker.py` loads `best_deepfake_model.pth`
4. **Results**: Model predictions stored in database + returned to frontend

## 🚀 To Use Your Trained Model

### Option 1: Full Backend Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start database services
cd c:\Users\Lenovo\Dark-Nexis
docker-compose up db redis minio -d

# Terminal 2: Start backend
cd dark-nexis-backend/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Terminal 3: Frontend (already running)
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Test Integration Without Full Backend
The frontend now gracefully falls back to mock analysis if backend is unavailable, but shows clear indicators about backend status.

## 🔧 What I Fixed

### 1. Upload Integration
- `UploadCard.tsx` now makes real API calls instead of just simulation
- Proper error handling with fallback to mock if backend unavailable
- Progress tracking for real S3 uploads

### 2. Analysis Connection  
- Frontend calls `/api/analyze` which triggers your trained model
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates (when backend running)
- Clear messaging about backend status

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when backend unavailable
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback analysis with clear labeling

## 📊 Testing Your Integration

### Test 1: Frontend Only (Current State)
1. Upload a file → Should see "Backend unavailable - using mock analysis"
2. Analysis completes with mock results
3. Results show "Fallback Mode" in model version

### Test 2: With Backend Running
1. Start backend services (see Option 1 above)
2. Upload a file → Should see "Starting analysis with trained model"
3. Your actual model processes the file
4. Results show real predictions from your trained model

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

1. **React State Warning**: Fixed `setTimeout` wrapper for state updates
2. **Import Issues**: Fixed all `sonner@2.0.3` → `sonner` imports
3. **WebSocket Errors**: Added robust fallback mechanism
4. **Disconnected Upload**: Connected frontend upload to backend analysis
5. **Mock vs Real**: Clear differentiation between mock and real analysis

## 💡 Key Improvements

1. **Unified Upload Flow**: Single component handles both mock and real uploads
2. **Real Progress Tracking**: Actual S3 upload progress + analysis stages
3. **Backend Health Detection**: Automatically detects if backend is available
4. **Model Metadata**: Shows which model version is being used
5. **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallback ensures app always works

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Your model IS integrated** - backend just needs to be running
- **Frontend works independently** - graceful degradation to mock analysis
- **Database required** - for file metadata and analysis results
- **S3/MinIO required** - for actual file storage
- **Redis required** - for async task processing

Your trained model integration is now **properly configured**! Start the backend services to see your real model in action.
