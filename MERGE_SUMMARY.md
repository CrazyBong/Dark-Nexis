# Backend Branch Merge Summary

## Changes Made

1. **CI Workflow Fix** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
   - Changed Python version from 3.10 to 3.9 for consistency with Docker environments
   - Added system dependency installation step for `ffmpeg`, `libsm6`, and `libxext6`
   - Modified dependency installation to use CPU versions of ML packages:
     - `torch==2.0.0+cpu` and `torchvision==0.15.0+cpu`
     - `opencv-python-headless>=4.7.0` instead of `opencv-python`
   - Added `--no-dependencies` flag when installing workers requirements to avoid conflicts

2. **Workers Requirements Update** (`workers/requirements.txt`):
   - Replaced `onnxruntime-gpu` with `onnxruntime` for better CI compatibility
   - Replaced `opencv-python` with `opencv-python-headless` for server environments

3. **Created CI Fix Report** (`CI_FIX_REPORT.md`):
   - Documented the root causes of the CI failure
   - Provided detailed solution implementation
   - Added recommendations for long-term maintenance

4. **Git Ignore Update** (`.gitignore`):
   - Added model files (*.pth, *.pt, *.h5, *.keras) to gitignore to prevent large files from being tracked
   - Removed `best_deepfake_model.pth` (43MB) from git tracking

## Merge Status

The changes have been committed to the repository and pushed to the remote origin.

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the CI pipeline to ensure the dependency installation step now passes
2. Verify that all tests run successfully in the CI environment
3. Check that the application still functions correctly in local development environments
4. Confirm that the large model file is no longer causing issues with git operations
